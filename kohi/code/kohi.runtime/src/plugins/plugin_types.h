 * isn't saved because it is only called the first time the plugin is loaded.
 *
 * NOTE: There must be an exported function named the same as _each_ parameter for it
 * to get picked up automatically. For example, the "vulkan renderer" plugin must have
 * an exported function called "kplugin_create". This is automatically found via dynamic
 * linking by name, and thus the names must match to facilitate automatic linking.
